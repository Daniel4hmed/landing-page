# Landing Page Project
This project was built to help embed the skills learned from the HTML and CSS sections from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). The project mainly focusses on creating layouts using flexbox.

## Known Issues
[ ] Hero image doesnt wrap on smaller screen sizes due to the 'flex' property being set to grow equally. Removing this and and the 'height' property on the 'hero-container' fixes the issue.
